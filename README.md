# Grocer.ly
Grocer.ly was an ASP.NET project that consisted in build an online shop.

I build a Razor Pages app that displays each item in their store, complete with images, names, and prices. Each item will have its own “Details” page.

I used Page Models, routing, and Razor syntax to make it a reality.
